# Architecture Decision Records

One ADR per major choice. Format: each decision is a short Markdown section with **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**. The point isn't completeness — it's preventing "wait, why did we pick X?" three months from now.

Add new ADRs at the bottom. Don't edit historic ADRs except to flip their status (Superseded by ADR-N).

## ADR-001 — Domain: `foiltcg.com` over `foil.app`

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** The product is a Pokémon TCG scanner. Two viable domains were available: `foil.app` (cleaner, modern-app vibe, $30/yr) and `foiltcg.com` (keyword-rich, $12/yr). SEO target is `pokemon card value calculator` and adjacent long-tails.

**Decision.** Take `foiltcg.com`. The `tcg` substring is a partial-match keyword signal for the entire trading-card-game category, `.com` is the trust default for marketplace/valuation tools, and the cost is one third.

**Consequences.** Slight branding awkwardness — "foiltcg" is harder to say out loud than "foil dot app". For a product with primarily organic + word-of-Twitter acquisition, the SEO + trust gain outweighs the brand cost. If we ever pivot to multi-TCG (parked, see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md#parked--explicitly-deferred)), the `tcg` suffix actually still fits.

## ADR-002 — Pricing data: PokeTrace + PriceCharting (Scrydex deferred)

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Status:** Accepted — Scrydex migration tracked in [ROADMAP item #9](ROADMAP.md#next--next-2-weeks-2026-05-28--2026-06-10)

**Context.** Three viable pricing APIs: PokeTrace, PriceCharting, Scrydex. PokeTrace gives multi-source ungraded (eBay + TCGplayer + Cardmarket) and graded ladder. PriceCharting is best-in-class for graded comps with deep history. Scrydex has the cleanest per-card endpoint design but requires application + waitlist.

**Decision.** PokeTrace for ungraded + initial graded surface, PriceCharting for the full graded ladder (PSA 7-10, BGS 9.5/10, CGC 10, SGC 10). Defer Scrydex until we have a real use case (per-card programmatic landing pages) or hit PokeTrace rate limits.

**Consequences.** Two API surfaces means two failure modes — `lib/poketrace.ts` and `lib/pricecharting.ts` both have their own caching and error paths. Worth it because PokeTrace alone is too thin on graded depth. When we migrate to Scrydex it'll be partial — PokeTrace probably stays for the ungraded multi-source rollup.

## ADR-003 — Single-card scanning is the V1 primary UX; binder mode is an advanced toggle

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Original V1 design had the upload flow default to "binder page" (multi-card detect → identify pipeline). Real-world testing showed the binder pipeline takes 15-30s and has lower per-card confidence, while the primary use case ("I'm on Marketplace, is this Charizard worth buying?") is exactly one card. The single-card path can skip the detect pass and runs in 6-8s.

**Decision.** `mode=single` is the default in `app/upload/upload-form.tsx`. `mode=binder` is an explicit toggle labeled "advanced — scan up to 50 cards". The UI surface explains the speed trade-off inline.

**Consequences.** Most users never see the binder path. That's fine — binder is a power-user feature and a marketing differentiator, not the conversion-driving flow. The two paths share `runScanPipeline` in `lib/scan-pipeline.ts` so we maintain one identify+price code path with two entry points.

## ADR-004 — Brave Search for SERP context injection (2K/mo free fits 2x/week cadence)

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** The autonomous content engine needs to know what the top-3 Google results for a target query look like so generated posts can reference and beat them. Options: SerpApi ($50/mo at low tier), Brave Search API (2K queries/mo free, $5/CPM after), DataForSEO ($30/mo + per-call), or scrape Google directly (TOS violation + brittle).

**Decision.** Brave Search API on the free tier. At 2 posts/week × ~4-6 fetches per post (one for primary keyword + scrape top-3 outlines) we're well under 2K/mo even with retries.

**Consequences.** Brave's index is smaller and less authoritative than Google's, so the "top results" may not perfectly match what an actual searcher sees. Acceptable trade-off — the engine uses the outlines as competitive context, not as ground truth. Cache hits via `lib/seo/serp-fetch.ts` 24h cache keep usage well-bounded. Upgrade trigger: cadence change to >4 posts/week OR Brave-Google divergence becomes a measurable content-quality problem.

## ADR-005 — Twice-weekly content cadence: Mondays + Thursdays at 14:03 UTC

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Search engines reward update frequency for blogs in the indexing-velocity-sensitive phase (months 0-6 of a new domain). Daily is overkill for a solo founder pre-launch; weekly is fine but slow. Twice-weekly is the sweet spot for indexing signal without burning excessive Claude tokens.

**Decision.** Two cron entries: `'3 14 * * 1'` (Mon) and `'3 14 * * 4'` (Thu), both at 14:03 UTC (09:03 ET / 06:03 PT). The :03 minute mark avoids the global cron stampede at `:00`.

**Consequences.** ~$2/week Claude spend at current draft sizes. Backlog of ~35 cluster topics in `docs/seo-strategy.md` lasts ~17 weeks at this rate before exhaustion (tracked as [ROADMAP item #8](ROADMAP.md#next--next-2-weeks-2026-05-28--2026-06-10)).

## ADR-006 — Full autonomy: no human review step, gates as the safety net

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Status:** Accepted (with known risk — see [RISKS.md R-001](RISKS.md))

**Context.** The prior architecture drafted posts to `_pending/` and opened a review PR. John reviewed in the Vercel preview, merged or closed. That works but adds 5-15 min per post of human time — and the whole point of an autonomous engine is to remove that friction. Two options: keep manual review (safe, slow) or commit to autonomy + lean on quality gates as the structural safety net.

**Decision.** Full autonomy. The workflow commits direct to `main`. 8 quality gates enforce structural properties (word count, dollar figures, recent dates, Foil data citations, banned phrases, schema validity, FAQ length, internal links). If gates fail 3x with re-prompting, the run skips and logs.

**Consequences.** Quality gates check STRUCTURE, not FACTS. Hallucinated prices that have correct dollar formatting pass gate (b). Pre-launch and pre-traffic, this risk is acceptable. The kill switch (`AUTO_PUBLISH_WEEKLY_POSTS=false` repo variable) reverts to `_pending/` drafts. Risk tracked at [RISKS.md R-001](RISKS.md). Mitigation candidates in [ROADMAP item #15](ROADMAP.md#later--1-3-months-2026-06-11--2026-08-20).

## ADR-007 — 8 quality gates + 3 retries + skip-on-failure (not fail-the-build)

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** When the content engine fails its gates after retries, the workflow could (a) fail loudly so John fixes the prompt, or (b) skip the run silently so the next cron tries a different topic. Option (a) is louder but creates dead Mondays where no post ships if the engine is in a bad state.

**Decision.** Skip-on-failure (option b). The script exits with code 2 on gate exhaustion; the workflow treats exit 2 as "no commit, log a warning, move on." A webhook can optionally fire to alert John.

**Consequences.** If the engine ever enters a sustained bad state, we silently miss posts until John notices. Mitigation: every gate-exhaustion exit logs the full failure list to GitHub Actions output AND optionally POSTs to `WEEKLY_POST_WEBHOOK_URL`. Re-evaluate this trade-off if we ever see ≥2 consecutive skipped runs.

## How to add an ADR

1. Pick the next number (don't reuse).
2. Title: short, specific. The choice + the rationale, not the topic.
3. Sections: Status (Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated), Context (what was true that forced the choice), Decision (what we chose, concretely), Consequences (what now follows — costs, constraints, follow-ups).
4. If superseding an old ADR, edit the old one to add "Superseded by ADR-N" to its Status — don't delete it.
